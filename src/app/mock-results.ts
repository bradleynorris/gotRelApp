        description: 'These two will not have much to catch up on as Jon just left Sansa\'s side last season. Although they will need to discuss the ramifications of Jon bending the knee to Daenerys, and what effect that will have on the Northern Lords, of whom Sansa has been keeping calm in Jon\'s absence. Will the Northern Lords look past Jon\'s decision to focus on the larger task at hand or will they see this as another slight against the North and decide to back Sansa as the true leader of the Northern Houses? To further muddy the waters, Jon\'s lineage throws another wrench in the gears as Sansa will surely be seen as the rightful Wardeness of the North if Jon is revealed to not be the son of Eddard Stark, as we all know. Sansa has been proving herself capable of running the North in Jon\'s absence and Jon may see this as a way out of his obligation if news of his true lineage drives him to seek the Iron Throne for himself.',

Add to this that Sansa has been leading in the North very capably in Jons absence and when he shows up back at Winterfell with Dany on his arm, she could be taking a back seat to Jons new beau. One thought that can bring comfort in their relationship is their shared disdain for Cersei and desire to see the current Queen defeated. But just as Cercei tortured Sansa, Danys father burned Sansas uncle and grandfather alive. Not an easy thing to forget.',

Before Sansa fled Kings Landing with Littlefinger, Sansa and Tyrion seemed to be coping with their new arrangement, so there is hope that there is no bad blood between them. But Tyrion\'s still a Lannister, and Sansa may still take issue with hosting a Lannister in the Stark home, regardless of the situation. Both have travelled great distances and endured much hardship to get where they are now. Perhaps Sansa and Tyrion can bond over this and put their past behind them.',

Everyone will have a tough time trusting Jaime\'s intentions as he arrives in the North, that\'s no secret. The one main connection between these two would be Brienne and her oath. Brienne was tasked by Jaime to find Sansa and Arya and ensure their safe return home, a task that proved to be far more difficult than all parties had hoped. It could be said that the only reason Sansa is still alive is because Jaime tasked Brienne with fufilling his agreement with Sansa\'s mother.

He was a central figure in the Lannister council during Sansa\'s time at the capitol, of which she is not likely to look fondly on. Much like Tyrion though, Varys has travelled a great distance and now finds himself at the side of Daenerys Targaryen, who will be presented as an ally to Sansa and the North if the day should come that they take arms against the Queen.

There was the time Joffrey ordered Clegane to strike Sansa if she wouldn\'t look at her father\'s severed head. Then there was the strange confrontation before Clegane\'s departure during the Battle at Blackwater Bay. The truth is though, their interactions were only ever frightning because of the control that Joffrey and Cersei had over The Hound. In the days since they last saw eachother, The Hound has travelled north of the wall alongside Jon, saved Arya from being another dead Stark at the Red Wedding and pledged his life to defeating the Army of the Dead. If that doesn\'t help Sansa come around on Sandor Clegane, what will? ',

Arya grew up as a starry-eyed tomboy, and Jon a bastard that never felt truly at home in Winterfell.  It\'s no wonder these two had such a great connection (from the two episodes we saw them together). As Sansa said, "Jon\'s heart will stop when he sees you\'ve returned." Add to this that Arya has become a great warrior AND still has the blade that Jon had made specifically for her before their departure, and we might finally see them both giddy with joy. A lot has happened to both of them throughout the last seven seasons, so their catching up may need to wait until the battle is won, but imagine how great it would be to see the two of them fighting side by side. I have goosebumps! Aside from all this, they are the only Starks who still have their Direwolves (albeit, neither seem to be nearby ever), and they both have Valyrian Steel weapons; great for killing White Walkers.

The many tales of Daenerys\' conquest through Essos and across the Narrow Sea will have likely piqued Arya\'s interest as well. Although Arya has not mentioned her at all, Dany seems like just the kind of hero that she would look up to. Additionally, Arya showed great interest in the dragon riders of Targaryen past and will likely be in awe of Drogon and Rhaegal. Arya could end up a bit starstruck by Daenerys. Add to this that Jon has given his full approval of Dany and we could see Arya treating her like the big sister she never had. The only thing that would muddy Arya\'s introduction to Dany would be the fact that she has chosen a Lannister and a Spider to be on her small council. Names that Arya has not had the best interactions with.',

Arya and Tyrion had never had much interaction as Tyrion was sleeping off-site at Winterfell and he did not travel back to Kings Landing with the rest of his family in season 1. At the end of the day, though, his family name will not sit well with the naturally-untrusting Arya.  The Lannisters are responsible for the death of her father, mother and brother, Robb.  The one person Arya would like to kill most in this world, Cersei, is Tyrion\'s sister. The one who crippled Bran, Jaime, is Tryion\'s brother. It will take a lot for Arya to be comfortable with a Lannister in Winterfell again. One positive connection they have is that they both grew up adoring the stories of the Targaryen Dragonriders. And if they could see past all their differences, it would be interesting to see Arya discuss with Tyrion her interactions with his father Tywin at Herrenhall. Tywin was kind to Arya in a way that would likely seem foreign to Tyrion. ',

The only other tie between these two is the oath that Jaime swore to Catelyn Stark to ensure her daughters make it home safely to Winterfell. Technically, this was a success; even if her return to Winterfell had nothing to do with his attempt to send Brienne to find Arya.

Arya would try to warn her father but it would all be for naught as he would be executed all the same not long after, prompting Arya\'s escape from the capitol. This will be interesting to see if she can even make the connection (she didn\'t see the men, after all), and if she does, how she\'ll react to the man who may have had a hand in her father\'s death.

Most importantly, these two had serious chemestry and showed real signs of desire for eachother before they went their separate ways from the Brotherhood Without Banners. It\'s about time these two found love again! An interesting connection to think about: King Robert had once mentioned his desire to unite Houses with the Starks through the marriage of Sansa and Joffrey. That didn\'t come to fruition as Joffrey was discovered to not even be a Baratheon (and then he died ... so there\'s that).

The Hound saved Arya from certain death at the Red Wedding, but then tried to sell her to her aunt unsuccessfully. Arya chose The Hound over Brienne\'s company when they all first met, but then left him to die moments later. It\'s clear these two have a very complicated relationship. Clegane is no longer the heartless nomad he was before their departure. Arya is no longer the helpless little girl she was before their departure.

The biggest dynamic of this reunion will be Bran having to explain that Jon is not the bastard son of Ned Stark and that his parents are actually Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.

If Tyrion is trying to win two simultaneous wars (against the Army of the Dead and the Crown), Bran might be just the ally that he needs. On a personal level, the two had a fairly good interaction with eachother during their brief time together in season 1. Tyrion admittedly has a soft spot for cripples and provided the plans for Bran\'s modified saddle to allow him to ride a horse after he lost his ability to walk.

Now Jaime has abandoned that love to do the right thing and fight for the living and Brandon Stark isn\'t really the same person he was before. It is highly likely that Bran will not give two thoughts about the incident that caused his crippling, although if there was ever anything to snap him out of his Three-Eyed trance, this might be it. It is often said that Jaime\'s character arc is one of the best in the series; going from pretty-boy jerk to honorable humility. Coming to grips with what he did to Bran might be his hardest yet. Lastly, as Bran can see everything that has ever happened, it is worth noting that the Three-Eyed Raven might be the only person capable of corroborating Jaime\'s claim that he killed the Mad King to save millions of lives, relieving Jaime of the shame he has carried with him ever since that day.',
